# Chapter 18: The Foreign Exchange Market

## Foreign Exchange Market
- Appreciation and depreciation of the currency
- Behavior in the **long run**
- Law of one price
- Absolute and relative Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)
- Behavior in the **short run** => Supply and Demand analysis

## Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)
Assumptions:
- All goods are identical
- Trade barriers and transportation costs are low (or relatively constant)
- Goods are tradable
- Absolute PPP:
- $P_A = P_B \times e_{A/B} \Rightarrow e_{A/B} = \frac{P_A}{P_B}$

## Determinants of the exchange rate in the Long Run

- Higher domestic prices (higher $P_B$), lower $e$, depreciation of currency B.
- Higher trade barriers (higher $P_A$), higher $e$, appreciation of currency B.
- Higher productivity at B (lower $P_B$), higher $e$, appreciation of currency B.

## BigMac Index

- Indicates whether a currency is over-valued or under-valued
- Uses Absolute PPP theory to derive this conclusion

## Relative PPP

- Based on absolute PPP, but depicts the relation in percentage changes instead
- $\pi_A = \pi_B + \Delta \%e_{A/B} \Rightarrow \Delta \%e_{A/B} = \pi_A - \pi_B$

## Exchange rates in the short run

- The exchange rate is determined by the demand and supply of domestic assets relative to foreign assets

### Supply curve for domestic assets

- Assume it is fixed (vertical supply curve)

### Demand curve for domestic assets

- Has negative slope
- Higher exchange rate means domestic assets are more expensive abroad => less demand.

## Determinants of exchange rates in the short run

- Domestic interest rates (higher demand of domestic assets)
- Foreign interest rates (less demand of domestic assets)
- Expected future exchange rate (higher demand of domestic assets)
- Changes in the Money Supply?
